Welcome to my GitHub profile

I'm a 24 year old self-taught developer in the PNW. My goal is to eventually get into tech spaces working on machine learning, AI, working on OS, and building systems that empower and help people and the environment. For now I'm working on getting into the tech space by developing my full stack skills. I would love to contribute and help in projects along these lines so feel free to reach out!
